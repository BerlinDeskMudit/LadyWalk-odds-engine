# QA — L8 Design Sign-off Tracker

> 58 questions a staff/principal engineer would force you to answer before signing off on the design. **One GitHub issue per question.** This file is the index; the issues are the work.

[repo](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine) · [all 58 issues](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues) · [open](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) · [closed](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) · [MVP milestone](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/milestone/1)

## How this works

A question is **not** answered because someone typed a paragraph. It is answered when the linked issue is closed with its acceptance criteria met and the artefact committed. A question whose answer is "we decided not to build this" is still answered — say so in the issue and close it.

| Label | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type:` | `feat` · `bug` · `task` · `spike` | `feat` capability to build · `bug` defect class to eliminate · `task` process/ops/research · `spike` needs measurement before a decision |
| `priority:` | `critical` · `high` · `medium` · `low` | `critical` = money-correctness or regulatory safety · `high` = blocks a core guarantee |
| `area:` | 11 subsystem labels | see the section headings below |

Milestones encode phase, not urgency:

#### Q01 · Enforce integer-only money representation (no floats anywhere)

[Issue #1](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/1) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> Do I store money as integers (cents) or fixed-point decimals — and have I banned floats everywhere, including in the ORM layer?

**Why it matters.** A single float rounding error in a payout path is a financial defect that is invisible in unit tests and catastrophic in production. The ban has to be enforced mechanically, not by convention.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR `docs/adr/0001-money-representation.md` picks integer minor units (cents) over fixed-point decimal, with rationale
- [ ] `Money` value type in the domain layer: immutable, not constructible from float, explicit currency
- [ ] DB type is `BIGINT` minor units + `currency CHAR(3)`; no NUMERIC/FLOAT/REAL money columns
- [ ] CI lint gate fails the build on `float(`, `Float`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `NUMERIC` in money paths
- [ ] JSON boundary layer explicitly coerces or rejects float money input
- [ ] Unit tests for currency boundary behaviour (JPY zero-decimal, KWD three-decimal)

<a id="q02"></a>

#### Q02 · Define canonical market -> outcome -> bet -> settlement schema

[Issue #2](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/2) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> What's my canonical schema for `market -> outcome -> bet -> settlement` — and is it normalized enough to avoid update anomalies during grading?

**Why it matters.** Grading mutates market state. If bet and settlement facts live in the same row as mutable market state, a re-grade silently rewrites history.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ERD in `docs/schema.md` with a 3NF target and explicit denormalizations
- [ ] Migrations exist for all four entities with FKs and constraints
- [ ] Immutable vs mutable columns enumerated per table
- [ ] Written argument for each deliberate denormalization
- [ ] Constraint tests prove a re-grade cannot alter a settled bet's payout facts

<a id="q03"></a>

#### Q03 · Build immutable append-only double-entry ledger; derive balance

[Issue #3](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/3) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> Am I using a single mutable `balance` column, or a full immutable, append-only ledger (debits/credits) that balance is *derived* from?

**Why it matters.** A mutable balance column is unrecoverable history. Every dispute ('you took my money') becomes unfalsifiable.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] `ledger_entries` is append-only: no UPDATE/DELETE path exists, enforced at the DB level
- [ ] Balance is a derived projection (materialized), never the source of truth
- [ ] Every entry carries account_id, direction, amount_minor, currency, posted_at, reference_type, reference_id
- [ ] Reversal is a new compensating entry, never a mutation
- [ ] Documented chart of accounts: user wallet, platform liability, platform revenue, margin, fees

<a id="q04"></a>

#### Q04 · Enforce and continuously test the double-entry sum-to-zero invariant

[Issue #4](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/4) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> If ledger-based: how do I guarantee the ledger always sums to zero across the system (double-entry invariant), and how do I test that invariant continuously?

**Why it matters.** Sum-to-zero is the single property that makes a ledger trustworthy. It must hold at transaction level, batch level, and in production continuously.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Transaction-level enforcement: postings cannot commit unbalanced (DB constraint or serializable transaction)
- [ ] Continuous per-account/per-currency invariant checker running in production
- [ ] CI property test: randomized entry sequences always sum to zero
- [ ] Alert fires on any imbalance within minutes (see #51)
- [ ] Documented recovery procedure when an imbalance is detected

<a id="q05"></a>

#### Q05 · Add immutable odds history with an as-placed execution record

[Issue #5](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/5) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> How do I version odds over time — do I keep an immutable odds history table so I can prove what odds a user actually got, forever?

**Why it matters.** This is the regulatory and audit record. Without it, a dispute over what price was offered cannot be settled.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] `odds_history` append-only, one row per odds version per outcome
- [ ] Each bet stores the exact `odds_version_id` it executed against
- [ ] Odds versions are never updated or deleted
- [ ] Retention and archival policy documented
- [ ] One-query answer to: 'what odds did user X receive at time T?'

<a id="q06"></a>

#### Q06 · ADR: as-of state reconstruction — event sourcing vs snapshot + delta

[Issue #6](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/6) · `task` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What's my strategy for storing 'as of' state — can I reconstruct exactly what any market looked like at any past timestamp (event sourcing vs snapshot + delta)?

**Why it matters.** This determines the shape of every table and every future migration. Expensive to reverse once shipped.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR comparing both approaches against our actual read patterns
- [ ] Explicit statement of the reconstruction guarantee we are signing up for
- [ ] Prototype proving the chosen approach answers the as-of query
- [ ] Consequences for the schema in #2 documented

<a id="q07"></a>

#### Q07 · Model void / push / partial-void outcomes without corrupting settlement history

[Issue #7](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/7) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do I model void/push/partial-void outcomes without corrupting historical settlement records?

**Why it matters.** Voids are the most common post-settlement event. Modelling them as an UPDATE destroys the record of what was originally paid.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Documented semantics for void / push / partial-void / cancelled
- [ ] Void implemented as a new state plus compensating ledger entries, never a mutation
- [ ] Original settlement record preserved and linked to its reversal
- [ ] Tests for every void variant, including partial on multi-outcome markets

#### Q08 · Choose and implement the per-market bet serialization strategy

[Issue #8](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/8) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> When 10,000 users hit 'place bet' on the same market within 50ms of each other, what serializes them — DB row locks, optimistic concurrency with retry, or a single-writer queue per market?

**Why it matters.** This is the central concurrency decision. Everything in #9 through #14 depends on it.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR naming the chosen mechanism, with the trade-off against the other two written out
- [ ] Implementation with a documented per-market critical section boundary
- [ ] Documented ordering guarantee (FIFO? arrival at DB? arrival at gateway?)
- [ ] Demonstrated at 10k/50ms via the #52 load test
- [ ] Documented throughput ceiling and behaviour at saturation

<a id="q09"></a>

#### Q09 · Make bet placement + balance deduction a single ACID transaction

[Issue #9](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/9) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> Is bet placement + balance deduction wrapped in a single ACID transaction, or is it two-phase across services — and if the latter, what's my compensation/saga logic on partial failure?

**Why it matters.** Splitting these two writes is the largest single source of money-loss defects: bet accepted but not charged, or charged but no bet.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR: single ACID transaction as the default unless there is a stated reason otherwise
- [ ] Both writes in one transaction; isolation level named and justified
- [ ] If a saga is used: every step has a compensating action, and the compensation is itself tested
- [ ] No code path writes a bet without a corresponding ledger entry
- [ ] Failure-injection test proves no orphan bet and no orphan debit

<a id="q10"></a>

#### Q10 · Eliminate TOCTOU double-spend in balance check-then-deduct

[Issue #10](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/10) · `bug` · `critical` · **MVP**

> How do I prevent a double-spend where a user's balance check and balance deduction race across two concurrent requests (classic TOCTOU)?

**Why it matters.** This is a defect class, not a feature. It is exploitable by a user sending two concurrent requests and it is completely silent in manual testing.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Root cause written up: the check and the deduct are not one atomic step
- [ ] Deduction is conditional at the storage layer (`UPDATE ... WHERE balance >= amount`, or `SELECT FOR UPDATE`)
- [ ] Concurrency test fires N simultaneous debits and asserts the balance never goes negative
- [ ] Regression test added to CI, verified to fail against the pre-fix code

<a id="q11"></a>

#### Q11 · Benchmark SELECT FOR UPDATE vs advisory locks vs optimistic versioning on the wallet row

[Issue #11](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/11) · `spike` · `high` · **MVP**

> Am I using SELECT FOR UPDATE, advisory locks, or optimistic versioning (version column + compare-and-swap) on the wallet row — and what's the throughput ceiling of each?

**Why it matters.** The answer is an empirical number, not an opinion. Guessing here invalidates the entire capacity model.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Benchmark harness measuring all three at 1, 10, and 100 concurrent writers
- [ ] Reported throughput (ops/sec), p99 latency, and deadlock rate for each
- [ ] Written recommendation tied to the measured numbers
- [ ] Chosen option fed back into #8

<a id="q12"></a>

#### Q12 · ADR: wallet sharding and cross-shard transaction atomicity

[Issue #12](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/12) · `task` · `low` · **Future Work**

> If I shard the wallet table, how do I keep balance-deduction transactions atomic across shard boundaries (or do I ensure a user's wallet is always single-shard)?

**Why it matters.** Premature sharding is expensive. Sharding done wrong silently breaks money atomicity.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR on the sharding key (recommend: hash on user_id so a wallet is always single-shard)
- [ ] Documented cross-shard transaction strategy if sharding is ever adopted
- [ ] Explicit decision on whether to shard before reaching 100k users
- [ ] Migration path documented

<a id="q13"></a>

#### Q13 · Design and implement idempotency keys for bet placement and settlement

[Issue #13](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/13) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> What's my idempotency key design so a client retry (network blip) never double-places a bet or double-pays a settlement?

**Why it matters.** Client retries are not exceptional — mobile networks produce them constantly. Without idempotency, every retry is a silent double-charge.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] `idempotency_key` unique constraint scoped per user per operation
- [ ] Key is a client-generated UUID; the server stores the full response and replays it on retry
- [ ] Concurrent duplicates with the same key return the same result, not a second bet
- [ ] Key retention longer than any client retry window
- [ ] The settlement payout path is idempotent too

<a id="q14"></a>

#### Q14 · Define last-odds / last-slot race semantics

[Issue #14](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/14) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> How do I handle the 'last odds/last slot' race — first-writer-wins, queue-based FIFO, or do I reject and let the client re-quote?

**Why it matters.** In-play markets close while requests are in flight. The chosen semantics must be consistent and must not be gameable.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR naming the policy and the user-visible error
- [ ] Implementation: bet rejected with a distinct, documented error code on stale odds
- [ ] Client contract for re-quote defined and documented
- [ ] Race test: a bet arriving after market close is rejected, not silently accepted

#### Q15 · ADR: choose fixed-odds, pari-mutuel, or exchange matching model

[Issue #15](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/15) · `task` · `critical` · **MVP**

> Is this fixed-odds, pari-mutuel pool, or exchange-style (peer matching) — and do I understand that these three have completely different concurrency and liability models?

**Why it matters.** The most consequential decision in the repository. Every other subsystem design is downstream of it.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR comparing all three on: concurrency model, liability model, capital requirement, regulatory surface, implementation cost
- [ ] Explicit choice with rationale
- [ ] Consequences enumerated for #16, #17, #18, and #38
- [ ] Documented regulatory/licensing implications (documented as research, not legal advice)

<a id="q16"></a>

#### Q16 · Decide and implement where the vig / margin is applied

[Issue #16](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/16) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> Where does the vig/margin get baked in — at market creation, or dynamically as liability shifts?

**Why it matters.** Where the vig lives determines whether margin is a modelled number or an emergent result — and whether it is auditable after the fact.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR on static vs dynamic vig
- [ ] Vig applied in exactly one documented place, not scattered across the code
- [ ] Margin is computed, stored, and attributable per market
- [ ] Tests assert the expected platform margin for a known bet sequence

<a id="q17"></a>

#### Q17 · Evaluate the odds update function: linear vs logistic vs LMSR-style curve

[Issue #17](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/17) · `spike` · `high` · **MVP**

> If odds move based on bet volume, what's the update function — linear, logistic, or a proper market-maker curve (e.g., something LMSR-like)?

**Why it matters.** A naive update function produces pathological odds under load — exactly the moment correctness matters most.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] All three candidates implemented
- [ ] Compared on: stability under concentrated volume, divergence, computability, auditability
- [ ] Written selection with a worked example
- [ ] Property tests: no combination of bets drives implied probability outside (0,1) or past the liability cap

<a id="q18"></a>

#### Q18 · Implement per-outcome platform liability cap and cap-breach behaviour

[Issue #18](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/18) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> How do I cap my platform's liability on any single outcome, and what happens when a cap is hit mid-bet (reject, requeue, auto-hedge)?

**Why it matters.** The liability cap is the platform's hard financial backstop. Its breach behaviour must be defined, not emergent.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Per-outcome liability tracked in real time
- [ ] Cap-breach behaviour explicitly chosen and implemented (reject / reprice / halt)
- [ ] Breaches raise an alert, not just an error
- [ ] Test: betting up to and past the cap produces defined, asserted behaviour
- [ ] Runbook for a cap breach

<a id="q19"></a>

#### Q19 · Bind bet execution to a server-signed odds quote with slippage tolerance

[Issue #19](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/19) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> Do I snapshot the odds a user sees vs. the odds at execution time — and what's my tolerance/slippage policy if they differ?

**Why it matters.** The client must never be able to assert what price it saw (see #42). The server must decide, and the tolerance must be explicit.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Quote token issued by the server on odds fetch, signed and short-lived
- [ ] Bet execution validates the token and matches it to the current odds version
- [ ] Slippage tolerance defined numerically and enforced
- [ ] Rejection path returns a fresh quote so the client can retry
- [ ] Tests for: within tolerance, outside tolerance, expired token, forged token

<a id="q20"></a>

#### Q20 · Invalidate stale odds across all connected clients within a latency budget

[Issue #20](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/20) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do I stale-invalidate odds across all connected clients within an acceptable latency budget?

**Why it matters.** A client holding a stale price is either about to place a rejected bet, or about to be arbitraged.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Staleness budget defined numerically
- [ ] Invalidations pushed (not polled) to every subscriber of a market
- [ ] Measured end-to-end propagation latency under load
- [ ] Alert if propagation exceeds the budget

#### Q21 · ADR: WebSockets vs SSE vs long-polling, justified on reconnection semantics

[Issue #21](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/21) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> WebSockets, SSE, or long-polling — and can I justify the choice against reconnection semantics, not just 'WebSockets are cool'?

**Why it matters.** The transport choice constrains reconnection, resume, and proxy behaviour for the rest of the project's life.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR comparing all three on: reconnection, resume-with-token, proxy/load-balancer support, client complexity, battery cost
- [ ] Explicit choice with rationale
- [ ] Documented heartbeat and dead-connection detection

<a id="q22"></a>

#### Q22 · Fan out odds updates to 100K+ connections without per-server socket maps

[Issue #22](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/22) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you fan out odds updates to potentially 100K+ concurrent connections without every app server holding a giant socket map — Redis pub/sub, Kafka + a thin gateway layer, or a dedicated real-time service?

**Why it matters.** Every app server holding 100K sockets is both an OOM risk and a deploy-stall waiting problem.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR naming the fanout architecture
- [ ] Implementation with a thin, stateless gateway tier
- [ ] Measured: 100K concurrent connections on documented hardware
- [ ] Gateway deploys do not drop connections

<a id="q23"></a>

#### Q23 · Implement reconnect resync via snapshot + delta

[Issue #23](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/23) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> On reconnect, how does a client resync to current state without replaying every event since disconnect (snapshot + delta vs full replay)?

**Why it matters.** Full replay is O(disconnect duration) and blows up on exactly the reconnect thundering herd it creates.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Client sends its last-seen sequence number
- [ ] Server returns snapshot + missed delta, or a fresh snapshot if the gap is too large
- [ ] Sequence numbers are gap-detectable, so a silently dropped message is detectable
- [ ] Test: client disconnects mid-event, reconnects, state matches exactly

<a id="q24"></a>

#### Q24 · Handle backpressure for slow clients during high-velocity in-play updates

[Issue #24](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/24) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you handle backpressure when a slow client can't keep up with odds update velocity during a live in-play event?

**Why it matters.** One slow client on an unbounded per-connection queue is a memory leak that takes down the node.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Bounded per-connection queue with a defined overflow policy (drop and force resync)
- [ ] Slow-consumer detection and disconnection
- [ ] Explicitly document and test that odds are snapshotted state, so dropping intermediate updates is safe
- [ ] Memory ceiling per connection measured

<a id="q25"></a>

#### Q25 · Design hot-market fanout for a 50K-socket thundering herd

[Issue #25](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/25) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What's my fanout architecture if one market suddenly needs to push to 50K sockets simultaneously (a 'hot market' thundering herd)?

**Why it matters.** Popularity is spiky and correlated. Capacity planning against average traffic does not survive a final.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Documented hot-market strategy (subscription-based routing, partitioned fanout, or a dedicated channel)
- [ ] Measured: single market pushed to 50K subscribers
- [ ] Other markets' update latency unaffected by a hot market
- [ ] Runbook for a hot market

#### Q26 · Implement the grading pipeline with human override and override audit trail

[Issue #26](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/26) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> Is grading manual, automated via a results feed, or hybrid with human override — and what's the audit trail on overrides?

**Why it matters.** Overrides are the highest-risk admin action in the system. Unattributable overrides are unacceptable.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Hybrid model: automated feed with a gated human override
- [ ] Every override records actor, timestamp, reason, and prior value
- [ ] Overrides on an already-settled market require a distinct elevated permission
- [ ] Audit log is append-only (see #47)
- [ ] Four-eyes or dual approval for high-value overrides

#### Q27 · Guarantee exactly-once payout execution across settlement job crashes

[Issue #27](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/27) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> What's your exactly-once guarantee on payout execution — how do you ensure a settlement job that crashes mid-run doesn't double-pay or skip users?

**Why it matters.** Exactly-once on money movement is a hard requirement. At-least-once double-pays; at-most-once skips users.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Idempotent payout with a stable per-bet payout key
- [ ] Atomic ledger write per bet, so a crash cannot half-apply a payout
- [ ] The job is resumable from where it stopped (see #28)
- [ ] Crash-injection test proves no double-pay and no skip
- [ ] Written statement of the exactly-once guarantee and its scope

<a id="q28"></a>

#### Q28 · Make settlement idempotent and resumable with per-batch checkpointing

[Issue #28](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/28) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> How do you make settlement idempotent and resumable (checkpointing which bets have been paid within a batch)?

**Why it matters.** A settlement run over a large market can take minutes. Without checkpointing, every failure restarts the whole thing.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Per-bet settlement status (`pending` / `paid` / `failed`) with retry
- [ ] Checkpoint written in the same transaction as the payout
- [ ] Resume skips completed bets without re-paying
- [ ] Failed bets retried with backoff, then quarantined — never silently dropped
- [ ] Test: kill the job at 30% and 70%, resume, assert exactly one payout per bet

<a id="q29"></a>

#### Q29 · ADR: wrong results feed after payout — reversal, clawback, and legality

[Issue #29](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/29) · `task` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What happens if a results feed reports a wrong outcome and I've already paid out — do I have a reversal/clawback mechanism, and is it even legal/expected to claw back?

**Why it matters.** A product and legal decision with real money attached. It must be made before settlement ships, not after the first bad feed.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR covering: automatic reversal, manual clawback, or no-reversal-and-eat-the-loss
- [ ] Research on user-facing terms for the chosen policy (cited, not legal advice)
- [ ] Reversal implemented as compensating ledger entries, never a mutation (see #3)
- [ ] User notification path defined
- [ ] Blast radius estimate: worst-case total exposure from a single wrong settlement

<a id="q30"></a>

#### Q30 · Enforce 'total paid out vs total staked minus margin' as a hard post-settlement invariant

[Issue #30](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/30) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> How do you reconcile 'total paid out' against 'total staked minus margin' as a hard invariant check after every settlement run?

**Why it matters.** This is the end-to-end financial correctness check. If it fails, real money is unaccounted for.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Reconciliation asserted after every settlement run, not sampled
- [ ] A mismatch fails the settlement run loudly — no silent continuation
- [ ] Reconciliation is part of the settlement job, not a separate report
- [ ] Tolerance is explicitly zero for the core identity; any rounding policy documented separately
- [ ] A mismatch page includes the account-level breakdown

#### Q31 · ADR: fail safe (halt) vs fail open (stale odds) when the pipeline dies

[Issue #31](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/31) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> If my odds-update pipeline dies mid-event, does the system fail safe (halt betting on that market) or fail open (accept bets on stale odds)? Which have I chosen and why?

**Why it matters.** This decision trades revenue for financial safety. It must be explicit and enforced in code, not by hope.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR with an explicit choice (recommend: fail safe — halt betting on the affected market)
- [ ] Implemented: a stale odds pipeline marks the market un-bettable
- [ ] `bettable` flag derived from a health signal with a defined TTL
- [ ] Test: kill the pipeline mid-event, assert new bets are rejected
- [ ] Documented user-facing behaviour and auto-recovery path

<a id="q32"></a>

#### Q32 · Implement a circuit breaker for upstream results and odds feeds

[Issue #32](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/32) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What's your circuit breaker strategy if the upstream results/odds feed goes down or starts returning garbage?

**Why it matters.** A feed returning plausible-but-wrong data is more dangerous than one returning nothing. Down is easy to detect; garbage is not.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Circuit breaker on every external feed: closed / open / half-open
- [ ] Garbage detection beyond availability: schema validation, sanity ranges, plausibility checks
- [ ] An open breaker halts the dependent flow (grading or odds) rather than passing data through
- [ ] Metrics on breaker state and transition count
- [ ] Alert on breaker open

<a id="q33"></a>

#### Q33 · Detect and quarantine a poisoned market before it causes financial damage

[Issue #33](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/33) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you detect and quarantine a 'poisoned' market (bad data corrupting odds) before it causes financial damage?

**Why it matters.** Corrupted odds propagate at fanout speed. By the time you notice, the exposure is already real.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Plausibility invariants on odds (implied probability in (0,1), non-negative, monotonic where expected)
- [ ] A breach marks the market quarantined and blocks new bets
- [ ] Quarantine is automatic, with a human path to release
- [ ] Blast radius measured: how far can bad odds travel before detection
- [ ] Runbook for a quarantined market

<a id="q34"></a>

#### Q34 · Define DR RPO/RTO for the wallet ledger specifically

[Issue #34](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/34) · `task` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What's your disaster recovery RPO/RTO for the wallet ledger specifically, separate from the rest of the system?

**Why it matters.** Losing bet and odds state is an outage. Losing the ledger is unrecoverable financial loss. Different answers are required.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Documented RPO and RTO for the ledger, distinct from application state
- [ ] Ledger durability design: synchronous replication, append-only log, and/or backups
- [ ] Restore actually tested, with a recorded drill result and timing
- [ ] Documented proof that the ledger is reconstructible from backups alone
- [ ] Cost of the chosen durability posture stated

<a id="q35"></a>

#### Q35 · Implement a platform-wide betting kill switch with defined trigger authority

[Issue #35](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/35) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> Do you have a kill switch to freeze all betting platform-wide within seconds, and who/what can trigger it?

**Why it matters.** During a live incident the only acceptable response is a single action that stops all money movement immediately.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Kill switch halts bet acceptance platform-wide within a stated number of seconds
- [ ] Trigger authority defined: which roles, which automated conditions
- [ ] Grading and settlement separately controllable
- [ ] The kill switch action itself is audited (who pressed it, when)
- [ ] Regular drill to prove it works — record the measured time-to-halt
- [ ] Documented reset procedure

#### Q36 · ADR: monolith vs services, and failure-domain separation

[Issue #36](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/36) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> Monolith vs microservices — and specifically, do wallet and bet-placement need to be separate failure domains from odds and market-data?

**Why it matters.** The minimum defensible split is the money path. Everything else can be a module.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR with the failure-domain requirement stated first and service boundaries second
- [ ] Explicit answer on whether wallet is separated from odds/market-data
- [ ] Rationale against premature microservices
- [ ] Document which component can be down without blocking bet acceptance

<a id="q37"></a>

#### Q37 · ADR: sync REST vs event-driven bet placement, with a p99 latency budget

[Issue #37](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/37) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> Sync REST for bet placement vs event-driven (Kafka) — what's my p99 latency budget for 'bet accepted' and does my choice hit it?

**Why it matters.** 'Bet accepted' is the user-facing promise. Without a number there is no SLO and no way to know if the choice works.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] p99 latency budget for 'bet accepted' stated as a number
- [ ] ADR comparing sync vs event-driven against that budget
- [ ] Explicit choice
- [ ] Measured p99 meets the budget — report the number
- [ ] Feedback the number into #48 SLIs

<a id="q38"></a>

#### Q38 · Horizontally scale bet placement while preserving per-market serialization

[Issue #38](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/38) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do I horizontally scale the bet-placement path without breaking the per-market serialization I designed in question 8?

**Why it matters.** Serialization and horizontal scale pull directly against each other. This is where that tension gets resolved.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Scaling strategy that preserves the #8 serialization guarantee
- [ ] Documented partitioning: which key is the serialization unit and how it maps to instances
- [ ] Rebalancing does not violate the guarantee — documented and tested
- [ ] Test: multi-instance concurrent placement on one market still serializes correctly

<a id="q39"></a>

#### Q39 · Define the read/write split for live odds reads

[Issue #39](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/39) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What's your read/write split — do live odds reads hit a read replica or Redis cache, while writes go to primary Postgres?

**Why it matters.** Read-path choice determines staleness tolerance, which determines whether read-your-writes is even possible.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] ADR: replica vs cache vs primary for each read class
- [ ] Staleness budget stated per read class
- [ ] Cache invalidation on odds write, not TTL-only
- [ ] Bet placement reads the authoritative value, never a cached one
- [ ] Measured read latency and cache hit rate

<a id="q40"></a>

#### Q40 · Handle hot-partition load when one market takes 100x all other traffic

[Issue #40](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/40) · `feat` · `low` · **Future Work**

> How do you handle hot-partition problems when one market (e.g., a major event) gets 100x the traffic of everything else combined?

**Why it matters.** Partitioning by user or by time both put a popular market in one place. This is the case that breaks naive designs.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Documented partition strategy and why it survives a hot market
- [ ] Mitigation: per-market rate limits, dedicated capacity, or queue isolation
- [ ] Load-tested with one market at 100x baseline
- [ ] Degradation behaviour defined (fail, queue, or shed)

<a id="q41"></a>

#### Q41 · Implement per-market rate limiting independent of per-user limits

[Issue #41](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/41) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> Do you need per-market rate limiting/sharding independent of per-user rate limiting?

**Why it matters.** Per-user limits do not protect a market. A thousand legitimate users can still overwhelm one market.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Both per-user and per-market limiters implemented
- [ ] Algorithm chosen and stated (token bucket or sliding window)
- [ ] Limits configurable per market — a low-liquidity market needs tighter limits
- [ ] Rate-limit responses distinguishable from validation errors
- [ ] Test: the per-market limit trips before the per-user limit does

#### Q42 · Reject client-asserted odds; require a server-signed quote for execution

[Issue #42](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/42) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> How do I prevent a client from spoofing the odds it 'saw' to force a favorable bet execution?

**Why it matters.** If the client can assert its price, there is no odds engine — just a client-controlled payout.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] The server never trusts a client-supplied odds value
- [ ] Execution requires a server-signed, short-lived quote token
- [ ] Forged, expired, and tampered tokens all rejected
- [ ] Tamper attempts logged as security events
- [ ] Penetration test covering price spoofing

<a id="q43"></a>

#### Q43 · Defend bet placement against scripted clients and staleness arbitrage

[Issue #43](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/43) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> What's your defense against a scripted client hammering the bet-placement endpoint faster than a human (bot arbitrage across odds staleness windows)?

**Why it matters.** Bots are faster and more patient. They specifically target the gap between a client's stale view and the server's current odds.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Bot heuristics: velocity, inter-arrival distribution, market-hopping behaviour
- [ ] The staleness window from #19/#20 measured and confirmed too small to be profitable
- [ ] Per-market and per-user limits (#41) as the first line of defence
- [ ] Detected bots: challenged, rate-limited, or blocked — behaviour defined
- [ ] Detection metrics and alerting

#### Q44 · Authenticate and audit the admin market-creation and grading panel

[Issue #44](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/44) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> How is the admin market-creation/grading panel authenticated and audited — can I prove who graded what and when?

**Why it matters.** Admin access is the single largest concentration of risk in the system.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Auth: SSO or MFA-required, no password-only admin accounts
- [ ] Least-privilege roles; grading and market creation are separate permissions
- [ ] Every admin action audited with actor, timestamp, and before/after values
- [ ] Session logging and periodic access review
- [ ] No admin action can mutate a settled payout directly (see #3, #47)

<a id="q45"></a>

#### Q45 · Fix the negative-balance exploit on the deduct path — validate and deduct atomically

[Issue #45](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/45) · `bug` · `critical` · **MVP**

> How do I prevent negative-balance exploits via race conditions on the deduct-then-validate path (should be validate-then-deduct, atomically)?

**Why it matters.** A defect class, not a feature. Reachable by any user with two concurrent requests, and completely silent in manual testing.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Root cause written up: validate and deduct are not one atomic step
- [ ] Conditional deduct at the storage layer — never read-then-write
- [ ] Concurrency test: N simultaneous debits exceeding the balance, asserting exactly one succeeds
- [ ] Balance is never observably negative, even transiently
- [ ] Regression test in CI, verified to fail against pre-fix code

<a id="q46"></a>

#### Q46 · Add replay protection to bet submission: nonces and signed timestamps

[Issue #46](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/46) · `feat` · `high` · **MVP**

> What's my replay-attack protection on the bet-submission API (nonces, signed timestamps)?

**Why it matters.** Without replay protection a captured valid request can be replayed indefinitely. This is independent of the odds-spoofing risk in #42.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Single-use nonce per request, enforced server-side
- [ ] Timestamped request with a bounded acceptance window
- [ ] Request signature (HMAC or asymmetric) verified before processing
- [ ] Replay attempts rejected and logged as security events
- [ ] Test: verbatim replay of a captured request is rejected

<a id="q47"></a>

#### Q47 · Log every state-changing action to an immutable, tamper-evident audit log

[Issue #47](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/47) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> Am I logging every state-changing action (bet placed, market graded, balance changed) to an immutable, tamper-evident audit log?

**Why it matters.** 'Immutable' and 'tamper-evident' are different guarantees. Ordinary application logs provide neither.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Every state change produces an audit record: actor, action, subject, before, after, timestamp
- [ ] Log is append-only and tamper-evident (hash chain or equivalent)
- [ ] Retention exceeds the regulatory dispute window
- [ ] The log is not writable by the application role
- [ ] A verification job proves the chain is intact, and alerts on a break

#### Q48 · Define SLIs and SLOs for bet placement, odds propagation, and settlement

[Issue #48](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/48) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> What are your key SLIs — bet-placement latency, odds-propagation latency, settlement completion time — and what are the SLOs?

**Why it matters.** No SLO means no definition of 'broken', and no basis for prioritising engineering work.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] SLIs defined for at least: bet-accept latency, odds-propagation latency, settlement completion, rejection rate
- [ ] SLO targets with error budgets stated numerically
- [ ] Document what 'bet accepted' means — the promise made to the user
- [ ] SLI instrumentation in place
- [ ] Alerting thresholds derived from the error budget

<a id="q49"></a>

#### Q49 · Run property-based invariant checks in production to catch silent settlement-math bugs

[Issue #49](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/49) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you detect a 'silent' bug where settlement math is subtly wrong but no error is thrown (property-based invariant checks running in prod)?

**Why it matters.** Wrong money maths typically does not throw. It returns a plausible number. Only an invariant catches it.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Production invariant checks: per-bet payout matches independent recomputation; market totals reconcile (#30)
- [ ] Sampled verification with a documented sampling rate and justification
- [ ] Any invariant breach pages — it does not log and continue
- [ ] The same invariants run on 100% of settlements in CI
- [ ] Precedent: a deliberately injected wrong-math bug is caught by the checker

#### Q50 · Build a real-time platform liability exposure dashboard per market

[Issue #50](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/50) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> Do you have real-time dashboards for platform liability exposure per market, so I'd notice before a $1M loss, not after?

**Why it matters.** Exposure is knowable in real time. If it is not visible, it gets discovered by the ledger.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Live per-market liability, expressed as worst-case payout if each outcome wins
- [ ] Portfolio-level total exposure
- [ ] Trend over time, not just a current number
- [ ] Approaching-cap warnings before the cap is hit (see #18)
- [ ] Alerting at configurable exposure thresholds

<a id="q51"></a>

#### Q51 · Alert on ledger imbalance with a defined detection threshold

[Issue #51](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/51) · `feat` · `critical` · **MVP**

> What's your alerting threshold for ledger imbalance (sum of all debits != sum of all credits)?

**Why it matters.** The correct threshold is zero. Anything else is a decision to tolerate known corruption, and it must be a conscious one.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Imbalance check runs continuously (see #4) and alerts at zero tolerance
- [ ] Alert includes the account-level breakdown and the implicated transaction
- [ ] Pages — not just a dashboard — on imbalance
- [ ] Runbook for a confirmed imbalance
- [ ] Drill: inject an imbalance in staging and verify the alert fires

#### Q52 · Load-test concurrent bet placement to surface races before users do

[Issue #52](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/52) · `task` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you load-test concurrent bet placement to surface the race conditions from question 8-14 before users find them?

**Why it matters.** Concurrency defects only appear under contention. Sequential tests will never find them, and neither will manual QA.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Load-test harness: 10,000 placements on one market within 50ms (the #8 scenario)
- [ ] Tests for: no double-spend (#10), no TOCTOU (#45), idempotency under retry (#13), correct last-slot rejection (#14)
- [ ] A sustained soak test, not just a spike
- [ ] Reproducible and wired into CI
- [ ] Results reported against the measured throughput ceiling from #11

#### Q53 · Add property-based tests fuzzing payout maths with random bet/settlement sequences

[Issue #53](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/53) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> Do you have property-based tests generating random bet/settlement sequences to fuzz for payout-math bugs?

**Why it matters.** Example-based tests only cover the cases their author imagined. Randomised sequences find the rest.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Property-based framework integrated (Hypothesis, fast-check, or equivalent)
- [ ] Properties asserted: sum of payouts = stake - margin; balance never negative; ledger sums to zero; re-grading is idempotent
- [ ] Void / push / partial-void included in the generated sequence space
- [ ] Seeded failures are reproducible and shrink to a minimal case
- [ ] Runs in CI on every PR

<a id="q54"></a>

#### Q54 · Test settlement idempotency by deliberately crashing the job mid-batch

[Issue #54](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/54) · `task` · `high` · **MVP**

> How do you test settlement idempotency — deliberately crash the job mid-batch in a test and assert no double-pay?

**Why it matters.** The crash path is the path nobody runs. It has to be tested on purpose, not hoped about.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Test harness that kills the settlement job at controlled points (30%, 70%, 99%)
- [ ] After each kill + resume: assert exactly one payout per bet, and every bet eventually paid
- [ ] Concurrent duplicate settlement runs assert no double-pay
- [ ] Failure injection at the DB level (connection drop mid-transaction), not just process kill
- [ ] Test runs in CI on every PR

#### Q55 · Chaos-engineer the real-time layer: kill a pub/sub node mid-event

[Issue #55](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/55) · `task` · `low` · **Future Work**

> What's your chaos-engineering plan for the real-time layer (kill a pub/sub node mid-event, verify clients resync correctly)?

**Why it matters.** The resync path (#23) is only ever exercised in production unless it is deliberately broken in staging.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Documented chaos scenarios: broker kill, gateway kill, network partition, duplicate delivery
- [ ] Automated chaos experiments in staging
- [ ] Expected client behaviour asserted per scenario (resync, no missed update)
- [ ] Blameless post-mortem template
- [ ] Guardrails so chaos never runs against production

#### Q56 · Guarantee zero-downtime deploys do not drop in-flight bet placement

[Issue #56](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/56) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you guarantee zero-downtime deploys don't drop in-flight bet-placement transactions?

**Why it matters.** Deploys are the most common self-inflicted outage in a system like this, and the fix is architectural rather than procedural.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Connection draining: in-flight requests complete before the instance exits
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with a bounded drain timeout, then forced exit
- [ ] Deployment window documented — ideally none
- [ ] Rolling deploy verified by placing bets continuously across a deploy in staging
- [ ] In-flight bet placement monitored during deploys

#### Q57 · Stand up staging with production-like concurrency load

[Issue #57](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/57) · `task` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> Do you have a staging environment with production-like concurrency load to catch race conditions before they ship?

**Why it matters.** Race conditions need load to appear. A low-traffic staging environment tells you nothing about #8 through #14.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Staging runs a load profile matching production concurrency, not a smoke test
- [ ] Same code path, same isolation levels, same infrastructure topology as production
- [ ] Synthetic load generator running continuously against staging
- [ ] Staging can be reset to a known state cheaply
- [ ] The race-condition suite (#52, #53, #54) runs against staging, not only unit-level in CI

#### Q58 · Version the odds and settlement calculation logic for auditable payouts

[Issue #58](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/LadyWalk-odds-engine/issues/58) · `feat` · `medium` · **Portfolio Depth**

> How do you version your odds/settlement calculation logic so I can prove *which version* computed a given historical payout?

**Why it matters.** Logic changes over time. Without versioning, a historical payout cannot be reproduced or defended.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Every odds version and every settlement carries the `calc_version` that produced it
- [ ] Old calculation versions remain runnable so a historical payout can be reproduced exactly
- [ ] Regression suite runs every historical calc version against golden cases
- [ ] ADR on the versioning scheme (semver vs monotonic integer vs git SHA)
- [ ] Demonstrate reproducing a specific historical payout byte-for-byte

## Adding a question

Questions are not written by hand in two places. Edit `issues.json` in the generator, re-run it, and QA.md plus the GitHub issue are produced from the same source. New findings go in as issues with the `area:` label and get a `Qnn` number on merge.
